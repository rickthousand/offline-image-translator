# Offline Image Translator

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the **Offline Image Translator** project! This is a super handy Android app designed to help you translate text directly from images, all without needing an internet connection. Perfect for those moments when you're traveling, studying, or just curious about text around you!

## ✨ What's This All About?

The main goal of this app is simple: point your camera at some text (or pick an image from your gallery), and get an instant, offline translation. No data? No problem!

## 🚀 Features

*   **Image Input:** Grab text from new photos taken with your camera or existing images from your gallery.
*   **Smart Text Recognition (OCR):** Uses Google's ML Kit to accurately recognize text in your images.
*   **Automatic Language Detection:** ML Kit also figures out what language the text is in, so you don't have to guess.
*   **Offline Translation:** The magic happens here! Translate between a whopping 59 languages, all powered by offline ML Kit models.
*   **Instant Re-translation:** Change your target language on the fly, and the app re-translates your text instantly.
*   **Model Management:** A dedicated screen lets you easily view, download, and delete the language models you need, keeping your app lean.
*   **Sleek UI:** Built with Material 3 for a modern and intuitive user experience.
*   **Custom App Icon:** Because every cool app needs a cool icon!

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

*   **Platform:** Native Android (Java)
*   **Key Technologies:**
    *   Google ML Kit: Text Recognition, Language Identification, Translation
    *   Material 3: For a beautiful and consistent UI

## 🚧 Development Journey (A Quick Peek)

This project has been a fun ride! We started from scratch, even migrating from Kotlin to Java, and tackled a bunch of Gradle and build challenges. We've implemented all the core features, refined the UI, fixed some tricky bugs (like a re-translation regression!), and made sure it's polished and ready to go.
